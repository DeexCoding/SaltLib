The project is on a break, however I still check pull requests and issues once in a while.

# SaltLib
SaltLib aims to be an alternative of the Sodium mod for Minecraft, but for legacy versions (1.3.2-1.13.2) of the game.
 
Might not compatible with Optifine in future

**Performance:**
  idk try it out
  seems like only 10% with modern devices but might have more improvement with Inter Intergrated GPU

**Requirements:**
  A gpu (can be integrated) made after 2008
